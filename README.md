# shallow-cnn-image-classification
This repository contains a Jupyter notebook implementing the shallow CNN architecture described in “[Shallow Convolutional Neural Network for Image Classification](paper/Shallow_CNN_for_Image_Classification.pdf)”. I demonstrate its performance on MNIST, Fashion‑MNIST, and CIFAR‑10 datasets.
